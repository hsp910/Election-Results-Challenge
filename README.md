# Election Results Challenge

## Background and Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to count the total votes for a US congerssional district race in Colorado. To do this we are using Python to read the csv files with the raw data on votes and then iterate through the data while keeping track of votes for candidates, as well as keeping track of the total votes counted in each county. Based on this data we are able to declare the winnner of the election as well as the larget voter turnout by county. This is done to show that Microsoft Excel is not the only platform that can be used to analyze raw data from csv files, and in fact may be more efficient in certain manners such as tracking votes by county and candidate.
